# WiFiJacker

A WiFi tool cut short and turned into a jammer/deauth tool.

Discontinued but not in vain, I learnt magnitudes of information and skills developing this, from CLI tool development basics, to deauth frames, to debugging packets with wireshark and more. Well worth experimenting and practicing.
